# HeroProgram
A fun interractive C# story line I buit to improve my programming skills when I first started C#

##Please do keep in mind this project is only for fun !

It does not have any other purpouse and was uploaded without many aspects I would correct with the given time.

It does not have a saving option, nor color, nor indications on how to use it.

It also was imported straight from the Rider IDE
